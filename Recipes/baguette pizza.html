<h2>How to Make Baguette Pizza Step-By-Step</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Split baguette in half lengthwise. Warm pizza sauce in a microwave-safe bowl until hot, about  45 seconds.</li>
    <li>Spread pizza sauce on baguette, sprinkle on cheese, and scatter sausage and pepperoni on top as desired. Place pizza onto a baking tray.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden, about 18 minutes. Optional step: turn on the ovenâ€™s broiler, set a rack 6 inches below the heating element, and broil the pizza for a deeper color, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cut pizza crosswise into slices. Serve and enjoy.</li>
